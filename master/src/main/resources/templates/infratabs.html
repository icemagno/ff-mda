			<b>Data Exchange</b>

				Uses peer-to-peer transfer over a synchronous HTTPS transport, backed by Mutual TLS authentication. X509 certificate exchange is orchestrated by FireFly, such that self-signed certificates can be used (or multiple PKI trust roots) and bound to the blockchain-backed identities of the organizations in FireFly.

			The Data Exchange connector must be started before any other to establish a secure communication channel between this Agent and others that will be started on remote servers.

		<div class="tab-pane" id="tab_2">The European languages are
			members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For
			science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The
			languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their
			most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would
			be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To
			achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar,
			pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce,
			the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than
			that of the individual languages.

		<div class="tab-pane" id="tab_3">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy
			text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
			the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
			unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
			specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
			leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
			was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
			containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
			publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
			Ipsum.

			A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like

			am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
			created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
			friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
			existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
			drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I
			never was a greater artist than now.
